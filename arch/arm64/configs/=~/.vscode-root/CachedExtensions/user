By default, only top-level modules are indexed (depth = 1). To index submodules, increase depth by 1 for each level of submodule you want to index. Accepted values are:\n```JSON\n{\"name\": \"package name (str)\",\n \"depth\": \"depth to scan (int)\",\n \"includeAllSymbols\": \"whether to include all symbols (bool)\"}\n\n```\nIf `include all symbols` is set to `false`, only symbols in each package's `__all__` are included. When it's set to `true`, Pylance will index every module/top level symbol declarations in the file.  \n  \nUsage example: \n```JSON\n[\n\t{\"name\": \"sklearn\", \"depth\": 2, \"includeAllSymbols\": true},\n\t{\"name\": \"matplotlib\", \"depth\": 3, \"includeAllSymbols\": false}\n]\n\n```\n","scope":"resource"},"python.analysis.diagnosticSeverityOverrides":{"type":"object","default":{},"description":"Allows a user to override the severity levels for individual diagnostics.","scope":"resource","properties":{"reportGeneralTypeIssues":{"type":"string","description":"Diagnostics for general type inconsistencies, unsupported operations, argument/parameter mismatches, etc. Covers all of the basic type-checking rules not covered by other rules.
